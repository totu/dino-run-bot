# Dinorunner bot

This is a python based bot that tries to beat Chrome's dino run game.

## How?

Instead of hacking the game and controlling the dino this bot tries to read the screen as cacti and pterodactyls approach and clear these obstacles.

## Setup

This bot is so far been coded exclusively on 13-inch MacBook Pro with Chrome taking left half of the screen. The `monitor` parameters need to be adjusted to your screen and PC separately (this is basically trial and error at this point)
To access the dino game you can use this URL `chrome://dino` or disconnect your Internet connection.
